# Smart Vocabulary Builder üß†‚ú®

A full-stack, AI-powered web application designed to make vocabulary learning more efficient, personalized, and interactive. This project leverages a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and the Google Gemini API to create a smart learning tool that goes beyond simple flashcards.

### ## üåü Core Features

* **Secure User Authentication:** Full registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, persistent user sessions.
* **AI-Powered "Add Word" Consultation:** Instead of just saving a word, the AI provides a rich, multi-part explanation, including:
    * A clear **definition**.
    * A contextual **example sentence**.
    * A creative **mnemonic** to aid memory.
* **Dynamic Content Regeneration:** If a user isn't satisfied with an example, they can click a button to have the AI generate a new, different one.
* **"Listen & Practice" Pronunciation:** A complete pronunciation tool that uses browser-native APIs to:
    * **Listen:** Play a clear, audible pronunciation of the word (Text-to-Speech).
    * **Practice:** Record the user's voice and provide instant feedback on their accuracy (Speech-to-Text).
* **Intelligent Spaced Repetition (SRS):** A core review system (powered by a backend priority queue) that schedules words for review at scientifically-backed intervals, maximizing long-term retention.
* **AI Word Suggestions:** A proactive feature that suggests new, relevant vocabulary to the user based on the words they've already learned.
* **Modern, Responsive UI:** A clean, beautiful, and mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide React icons.

VITE_API_URL="[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)"

# 4. Run the development server
npm run dev
```
### ## üîÆ Future Scope

This project has a strong foundation for many exciting features:

* **Gamification:** Implement daily streaks, XP (Experience Points), and leaderboards to motivate users and enhance engagement.
* **Multilingual Support:** Expand the application to allow users to learn vocabulary in other languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.
* **Advanced AI Quizzes:** Introduce more dynamic review sessions by asking the AI to generate varied question types, such as multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank exercises.
* **Dedicated Mobile App:** Develop native applications for iOS and Android using a framework like React Native, providing a seamless learning experience on mobile devices.
